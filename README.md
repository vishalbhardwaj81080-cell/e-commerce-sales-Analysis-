# e-commerce-sales-Analysis-
 Performed end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a messy E-commerce sales dataset using Python. Cleaned and preprocessed raw data, handled missing values and outliers, analyzed sales trends and customer behavior, and generated actionable business insights using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of an E-commerce sales dataset.
The main objective is to understand the data, clean it, analyze patterns, and extract meaningful business insights using Python.

EDA helps in identifying trends, customer behavior, sales performance, and potential data quality issues before building any machine learning or forecasting models.

 Dataset Description
	•	Dataset Name: E-commerce Sales Dataset
	•	Format: CSV
	•	Nature: Real-world inspired, messy dataset
	•	Contains information about:
	•	Orders
	•	Customers
	•	Products
	•	Sales & Revenue
	•	Dates & Categories

 Data Cleaning Steps Performed
 The dataset was not clean initially, so the following data cleaning steps were applied:
	•	Handled missing values
	•	Removed or treated duplicate records
	•	Converted data types (object → date, float → int where required)
	•	Standardized column names
	•	Extracted Year, Month, Day from date columns
	•	Handled zero / invalid values
	•	Checked and treated outliers
  
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 During EDA, the following analysis was performed:
	•	Descriptive statistics (mean, median, count, etc.)
	•	Distribution analysis of numerical columns
	•	Category-wise sales analysis
	•	Time-based sales trends (monthly / yearly)
	•	Customer behavior analysis
	•	Product performance analysis

 Visualizations Used
 To better understand the data, multiple visualizations were created using Matplotlib & Seaborn:
	•	Bar charts – Category & product sales
	•	Line charts – Sales trends over time
	•	Histograms – Data distribution
	•	Box plots – Outlier detection
	•	Pie charts – Sales contribution
	•	Count plots – Frequency analysis

 Key Insights
 Some important insights derived from the analysis:
	•	Certain product categories contribute the highest revenue
	•	Sales show seasonal trends across months
	•	Few products generate maximum sales (Pareto effect)
	•	Some customers are high-value repeat buyers
	•	Data quality issues significantly affect analysis if not cleaned properly

 Tools & Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	Pandas – Data manipulation
	•	NumPy – Numerical operations
	•	Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
